Final Project for the Developing Data Products 
class offered by Coursera
</small>

Project Background
========================================================
The final project's requirements are to create a Shiny application 
and to use Slidfy or RStudio Presnter to build a presentation. The basic
requirements are outlined in the final project description for the class. 
This project utilizes the famous **MNIST** hand digits data set available from Kaggle 
to train a standard neural network model for hand digit recognition. The Shiny user 
interface allows to run through different test images and their classification results. 
The links to the **GitHub repo**, **RStudio Presentation**, and a **Shiny application** 
are located at the last slide of this presentation.

Data Used
========================================================
The **MNIST** data set downloaded from Kaggle includes a train set
and a test set.
They contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits from zero to nine.
These images are 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total
of 784 pixels in total.
The training data set has 785 columns. The first column, called "label",
is the digit that was drawn by the user. The rest of the columns contain
the pixel-values of the associated image.
The test data set, is the same as the training data set, except that it 
does not contain the "label" column.

Digit Recognizer in R
========================================================
After training the model we can look at the confusion matrix. The total
error is 0.0413 which means 1-0.0413 = 0.9587 accuracy score.

Links
========================================================
To run the Shiny application, click on the link to the **Shiny application** 
found in the list below. The Shiny application should open in the **browser window** 
presenting short write up and a slider.
